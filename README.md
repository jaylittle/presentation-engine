# Presentation Engine 5.0

This repo is the code which runs my personal website https://jaylittle.com and my business website https://jplcoding.com

### 1. Would you recommend using this right now?

It screams like a bat out of hell and is relatively secure. If you don't like those things, don't use it now.  Use WordPress instead.

### 2. What the hell is this project anyway?

My version of a basic blog.  More info is available here:  https://jaylittle.com/article/view/presentation-engine

### 3. Your previous versions didn't have a license? What gives?

I've gotten old enough to give a shit. FOSS has done a lot of good for me over the years and its well past time I start returning the favor.

### 4. FOSS? This is .NET you silly man!

Yeah this port is being developed 100% on Linux.  The goal is for it to be able to work in a cross platform context, but I will be primarily developing it using tools available to me on various Linux Distributions.

### 5. What tools will I need?

VS Code is my primary development tool because its free and works great. Beyond that I've continued to use Gimp for the graphical work.

### 6. What do I need to have installed to run this?

Node.js, Yarn and the .NET Core 3.0 runtime.  We utilize yarn to pull down node packages we make use of which includes babel and webpack among others.  The .NET Core 3.0 runtime is a no brainer of course.  If you want to hack in the codebase, you'll want to also have the .NET Core 3.0 SDK installed.
